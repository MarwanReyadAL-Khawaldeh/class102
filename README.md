Why? The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better. And you can, too.	

What is a growth mindset?	
 that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.	

Since there is a concept called the growth mindset, it must be another type, which is the fixed mindset	
So what is a fixed mentality?	

 intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.	

 How do I remind myself of how to maintain a growth mindset?	
1. I remind myself that there are 16 hours a day, how can this time be used?	
2. I tell myself what weaknesses I have and how can I address them	
3. Always put my dream between my eyes so that I stay excited to reach it
